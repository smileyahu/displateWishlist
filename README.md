# displateWishlist
The displate.com Wishlist is not shareable. Created a script used in developer console to create a textfile containing my wishlist so I can share my Wishlist (PS: displate.com developers and Product Managers, a wishlist is made for sharing with your own family and friends. Birthday gifts etc. )

created with chatGPT

This script creates a text file named "wishlist.txt" containing the wishlist details. The download is triggered automatically, and then the dynamically created link is removed from the document. You can run this script in the browser's Developer Tools console while on the Displate wishlist page.

How to use the script:
1. Open the Displate wishlist page in your browser.
2. Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" to open the Developer Tools.
3. Go to the "Console" tab.
4. Now, paste the following JavaScript code into the console and press Enter:
5. And follow the Save Download Flow
